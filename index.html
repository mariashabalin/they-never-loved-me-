 <h2 class="center" style="color:pink;">Crystallized</h2>
<p class="center" style="color:pink;">
    Sitting here, <br>
    Crystallized, <br>
    Transformed to a structure, <br>
     So beautiful but paralyzed. <br>
    There’s no movement in my direction, <br>
    And I can’t go on without an addiction, <br>
    To knowing you’re feeling my heart. <br>
    
    Oh, don’t break this perfection, <br>
    The crafted connection of signs and delusional reflection. <br>
    Every wave that hits me is another high, <br>
    But without it, I’d honestly rather die. <br>
    
    I’m not being dramatic, I just feel so hard, <br>
    The way that water breaks up rocks into shards. <br>
    Cracks them open leaving only scars. <br>
    
    It’s like you etched your name on my body, <br>
    Every letter making me bleed. <br>
    But you’re thinking it’s just what a rock needs, <br>
    If only you knew that every time you pounded your chisel you took a part of me. <br>
    Left me crushed to pieces. <br>
    
</p>

    <p class="center" style="color:pink;">
        It’s alright if you don’t know who you are. <br>
        I’ll be standing right here through it all.<br>
        You say that you love me but you got a feeling<br>
        That everyone’s watching and you can’t believe it<br>
        That you like him<br>
        And you want him too.<br>
        
        When I was a young girl,<br>
        I told them about her,<br>
        But I couldn’t love her.<br>
        They said it was wrong,<br>
        So I won’t ignore you,<br>
        But I will implore you,<br>
        Don’t take your heart<br>
        and cut it off<br>
        'Cause I love you, <br>
        And it’s okay to want him too.<br>
        
        It’s human,<br>
        It’s beautiful, it’s amazing,<br>
        It’s not crazy,<br>
        It’s who you are.<br>
        It’s worth it,<br>
        To know it,<br>
        To love it,<br>
        To be with your heart.<br>
        
      
    </p>

  <h1 class="center" style="color:pink;">So, you say it was never about me. <br>
    Can you find the reason that you felt free?
  </h1> 
  <a href=""><img src="https://i.ibb.co/z445YhD/boy.jpg" alt="boy" class="center" /></a>

  <h2 class="center" style="color:pink;">Does the love I want exist in this world?
  </h2> 
  <p class="center" style="color:pink;">
    I lie here, thinking of you, <br>
As I often do.<br>
This time, however, I realized it might not be true—<br>
The dream I have of us, where you wear red and I wear blue,<br>
As a symbolic representation of our spiritual hues.<br>
It can't possibly be real; that which constantly plays in my head.<br>
The idealized form exists in the mind, but when materialized, <br>It's just a bunch of pale roses in the garden bed.<br>
There's not enough water to keep them red,<br>
The sun doesn't shine brightly enough, and they fail to live up to what was said.<br>
"They will be so beautiful, they will be so nice."<br>
But the months go by, only for their sweet fragrance to be trapped in winter's ice,<br>
And I think even if our love does compare to what's in my mind,<br>
It won't last a lifetime.<br>
Does that dissuade me from pursuing you?<br>
Not entirely, though it leaves me confused.<br>
Why do I follow what will be bruising, when I could sit and forever peruse,<br>
The depths of my imagination, the stories I've told,<br>
In an effort to construct the perfect love with my mirroring soul.<br>

    Brooklyn</h1>
  <h2 class="center" style="color:pink;">
    These streets are awake, <br>
  The lights offer a path to follow.<br>
  Look up and not down to see<br>
  The treetops and brims of the sky.<br>
  Look out to see the painted houses,<br>
  Of brick and melted yellow.<br>
  Nowhere to be seen is order,<br>
  The chaos is what makes it<br>
  Beyond words, beyond eyes.<br>
  It houses nostalgia of youth,<br>
  It fears and celebrates death.<br>
  This city is mine but not for long.<br>
  How I'll miss its descendants,<br>
  Its language of old,<br>
  The battered, the beaten,<br>
  All the untold.<br>
  </h2>


  <a href=""><img src="https://i.ibb.co/CpyMMRG/boy-1.jpg" alt="boy-1" class=center /></a>

  <p class="center" style="color:pink;">
    Had to change who I was <br>
To try and avoid the fear,<br>
Fear of feeling like myself again.<br>
All the things I held dear,<br>
They pained me,<br>
Made me cry<br>
Because it scared me,<br>
How much I wanted to die.<br>

I wanted fame to mask up all the pain.<br>
Wanted people to know what I’d been through,<br>
So I can be seen as a hero and not someone blue.<br>
Oh, someone tell me, has this ever happened to you?<br>

One day I looked at all the people,<br>
And had to wonder why<br>
They were so dishonest<br>
About their lives.<br>
They make it seem like they’re okay,<br>
But they’re breaking under the weight,<br>
Trying to make it, trying to find escape<br>
In this present day.<br>

  <p class="center" style="color:pink;">
    No, I don’t want to be alive to see the days that come after tomorrow.<br>
  Every day's another way to say goodbye to things that I have borrowed.<br>
  I had a dream last night—<br>
  Someone took my life.<br>
  I told you I loved you so,<br>
  Before I had to go.<br>
  We were hand in hand,<br>
  And the world did end—<br>
  It was just a dream,<br>
  But I cannot unsee<br>
  The need to be free,<br>
  A desire to see a life without me.<br>
  
  I’m still in love with you,<br>
  Hard to hear the truth.<br>
  I need you so much more,<br>
  I just can’t ignore.<br>
  No, I don’t want to be alive to see the days that come after tomorrow.<br>
  Every day's another way to say goodbye to things that you have borrowed.<br>

EVEN IN DEATH</h1>
<h2 class="center" style="color:pink;">
    Weakness, it’s my weakness to call you when I’m dead. <br>
    Flowers on my gravestone, but I’m standing at the foot of the bed.<br>
    Calmly write a letter to the bishop next door,<br>
    "Sorry to bother, but I have a lady on the floor.<br>
    She looks like my Mary, but she walks on all fours.<br>
    Take your choir boy; she always liked The Cure."<br>

<p class="center" style="color:pink;"> I fall asleep to the sound of the rain, <br>
    And I’ll have a dream that you’re with me again.<br>
    And in my heart, I’ll cry,<br>
    ‘Cause I don’t know when it’ll end.<br>
    
    I try so hard,<br>
    Tell me, is there a plan?<br>
    Count down tonight,<br>
    Like a lullaby.<br>
    
    It's so nice to have you here by my side,<br>
    In my sleep, that is.<br>
    Can’t have you in real life,<br>
    Why do you have to hide?<br>
    
    I want you to be mine, all mine.<br>
    </p>

 <h2  style="color:pink;">  I don't really like labels. 
  I'm having a human experience, just making the most out of existing. 
    This project is a piece of my heart, put together on my laptop in my bedroom. 
    "They Never Loved Me" showcases paintings, drawings, song lyrics, and poetry. 
    It's about my experience in this life, how torturous it can be at times, but how lovely 
    it all is in the grand scheme of things. All the pain and sorrow leads to a growth of my soul,
     and we're all here to grow, so maybe we can all realize that even if they never loved us, we can
      love ourselves.</h2>
